# Play with Mesa Library

## Mesa Library - Introductory Tutorial Study Note  

I am just trying to use mesa library with tutorial.  
I have ever used NetLogo, Swarm, and RePast; however, I thought those were troublesome for me because I do not like Java and Objective-C.  
On the other hand, we can write program in Python if we use mesa library. This is amazing!
