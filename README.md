## Mesa Library - Introductory Tutorial Study Note  

I am just trying mesa library readig tutorial.  
I have ever used NetLogo, Swarm, RePast, but I thought it was traoublesome for me because I do not like Java and Objective-C.  
On the other hand, we can write program in Python if we use mesa library. This is amazing!
